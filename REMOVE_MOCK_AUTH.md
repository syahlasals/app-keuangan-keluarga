# Remove Mock Authentication Configuration

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Mock Client**: The mock Supabase client implementation has been completely removed
2. **Real Authentication**: The application now uses real Supabase authentication in all environments
3. **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex placeholder detection logic that was causing confusion

## Before
- When environment variables were missing or contained placeholder values, the app would use mock authentication
- Demo credentials (`demo@example.com` / `password`) were required for testing
- No real user accounts could be created or used

## After
- The app always uses the real Supabase client
- You can now create accounts with real email addresses
- Sign in, sign up, and sign out work with actual Supabase authentication
- Environment variables are still required for the app to function

## Requirements

To use real authentication, you must have valid Supabase credentials in your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Testing

You can now:
1. Create real user accounts with any email address
2. Sign in with actual credentials
3. Use password reset functionality
4. Have real sessions persisted in your browser

## Notes

- If you want to disable authentication entirely for UI testing, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_AUTH=true`
- The app will show warnings if placeholder values are detected in environment variables
- All existing mock functionality has been removed
