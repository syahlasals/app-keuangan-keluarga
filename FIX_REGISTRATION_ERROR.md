# Fix Registration Error

## Problem
Users are experiencing a "Database error saving new user" error when trying to register, both in local development and deployment environments.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error is occurring in the Supabase database function `handle_new_user()` which is triggered after a new user is created in the auth system. The function is failing due to:

1. Potential constraint violations when inserting user data
2. Issues with inserting default categories
3. Lack of proper error handling in the database function

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Code
- Added detailed logging in the authStore signUp method
- Improved error handling in the Supabase client
- Added specific error messages for database-related issues
- Added better network error handling

### 2. Fixed Database Function
Created a new SQL script [FIX_DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.sql](file://c:\Users\ASUS\Kuliah\KP\app-keuangan-keluarga\FIX_DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.sql) that:
- Uses `ON CONFLICT` clauses to prevent duplicate entry errors
- Adds proper exception handling to prevent function failures
- Logs warnings instead of failing when errors occur
- Ensures the signup process continues even if the database function has issues

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Added more descriptive error messages for users
- Better handling of duplicate email scenarios
- Enhanced logging for debugging purposes

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Update the Database Function
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy the content from [FIX_DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.sql](file://c:\Users\ASUS\Kuliah\KP\app-keuangan-keluarga\FIX_DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.sql)
4. Paste and run the SQL script

### Step 2: Verify Supabase Configuration
1. Check that your redirect URLs are properly configured in Supabase Auth Settings:
   - For local development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
   - For production: `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/auth/login`

2. Ensure email confirmation is properly configured

### Step 3: Test the Registration
1. Try registering a new user
2. Check the browser console for any error messages
3. Verify that the user appears in the auth.users table
4. Check that the user profile is created in the public.users table

## Additional Debugging Steps

If the issue persists:

1. Check the Supabase logs in the dashboard for specific error messages
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the database schema is properly applied
4. Check that Row Level Security policies are correctly configured

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use `ON CONFLICT` clauses when inserting data
2. Add proper exception handling in database functions
3. Test database functions independently before deploying
4. Monitor Supabase logs for errors
